The best way to interpret user needs for a program is by separating user stories as small as possible so that the sprints can be planned accordingly to optimize the development process. This helps by giving the developers the developed user stories (which should be as clear and concise as possible) to develop the program based off of what the stories tell them to do.
I use to approach program development as a look at the bigger picture and try to get from start to finish in one way (waterfall method) and if I ran into any difficulties then I would either have to start fresh on the project or I would have to go back many steps to figure out where the difficulty lies. I plan to incorporate the process of dividing up large projects into smaller projects and doing miniature sprints with myself in order to maximize the quality of the program I produce and hopefully eliminate the number of mistakes or decrease the amount of time it takes for me to fix those mistakes.
A good team member in software development is a great communicator. They are open about the difficulties that they have and are not afraid to ask for help. They should also be able to hold themselves accountable in owning up to any mistakes that they may have made during the development process. They should be joining the team with the mentality of they are ready to learn something new and not I am perfect at what I do.
